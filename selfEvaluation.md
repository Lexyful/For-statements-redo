# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
- this portion was very confusing. I don't feel fluent at all.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- I was very resourcful. I watched someone in my small group write up the code so I was able to build mine off of that. I googled a lot as that was part of the assignment.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I may try this problem again in the morning before class or after school tomorrow. I'll have to see what spaces I can arrange.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I have some friends in the program I can talk to
