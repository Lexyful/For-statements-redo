// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.
  
// Challenge 1
// Use a for statement to log to the console all even numbers between 25 and 75.

for (var i = 25; i < 75; i++) {

console.log('filter');
}

  // the 'filter' array method is meant to  return a new array containing only the even numbers


// Challenge 2
// Use a for statement to log to the console a complete sentence stating the weather using the Array below:
var weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"]
  for (i=0; i < weather_options.length; i++) {
   console.log(`it's been a beautiful ${weather_options[i]} day`)
 } 



// Challenge 3
// Use a for statement to log to the console only the words that are exactly 3 characters in length
 var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]
 const array = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]
 array.forEach(item => {
  if(item.length <=3)  
  
  console.log(item)});


// ðŸ“¹ Record yourself live-coding and talking through any ONE of the challenges. 
  // The recording doesn't have to be the first time you are solving the problem. 
  // Use technical vocabulary and explain each part to demonstrate your understanding!
